It is recommended to install them at least 20 cm away from the LED strip and not cover them with decorative elements that might impede cooling.",
      "installation_3_q": "Do I need to offset from walls when installing the strip?",
      "installation_3_a": "Yes, it's recommended to offset 5-7 cm from walls. This creates more uniform lighting and prevents bright spots on the walls. The offset is also necessary to compensate for thermal expansion of the strip when heated.",
      "installation_4_q": "What's the proper way to connect multiple strip segments?",
      "installation_4_a": "To connect segments, use special connectors or soldering. When using connectors, make sure the contacts are clean and securely fixed. When soldering, use quality solder and don't overheat the strip. After connecting, check the reliability of the contact and functionality of all segments.",
      "technical_1_q": "Can the LED strip be cut?",
      "technical_1_a": "Yes, LED strips can be cut, but only at specially marked places (usually every 5 cm for RGB and 2.5 cm for white strips). The strip has special marks in the form of scissors or cut lines. Cut strictly through the center of the contact pads using sharp scissors.",
      "technical_2_q": "What is the maximum length of strip from one power supply?",
      "technical_2_a": "The maximum length depends on the power supply wattage and strip power consumption. For 7.2 W/m strips, the maximum length from one power supply is 10 meters; for 14.4 W/m strips - 5 meters. If a greater length is needed, use additional power supplies or signal amplifiers.",
      "technical_3_q": "How do I calculate the required power supply wattage?",
      "technical_3_a": "Multiply the strip length by its power per meter and add 20% reserve. For example, for a 5-meter strip with 7.2 W/m power: 5 × 7.2 = 36 W, +20% = 43.2 W. Choose a power supply with the next higher wattage, in this case 45 or 50 W.",
      "technical_4_q": "Why might the LED strip flicker?",
      "technical_4_a": "Flickering can occur for several reasons: insufficient power supply wattage, poor contact in connections, controller malfunction, or interference from other electrical devices. Check all connections, make sure the power supply matches the required wattage, and that there are no sources of interference nearby.",
      "warranty_1_q": "What should I do if part of the strip stops working?",
      "warranty_1_a": "First, check all connections and make sure the power supply is working correctly. If the problem is not there, contact our support service. In case of a factory defect, we will replace the defective strip under warranty at no cost. Keep your receipt and warranty card to confirm the purchase.",
      "warranty_2_q": "What does the warranty cover?",
      "warranty_2_a": "The warranty covers factory defects: LED failure, strip detachment from base, power supply or controller failure during proper use. The warranty does not cover mechanical damage and cases of improper installation or operation.",
      "warranty_3_q": "How can I extend the lifespan of the LED strip?",
      "warranty_3_a": "For maximum lifespan: ensure good ventilation, do not exceed nominal voltage, avoid mechanical damage, clean regularly from dust, prevent overheating. With proper use, the lifespan can reach up to 10 years.",
      "delivery_1_q": "How is delivery handled across Europe?",
      "delivery_1_a": "Delivery is free across Europe, as the cost is already included in the product price. We use reliable transport companies DPD and GLS for delivery. Delivery time is 3-7 business days depending on the country. Each order is carefully packaged for safe transportation. You can track the delivery status through your personal account or by the shipment number.",
      "delivery_2_q": "Why is delivery free?",
      "delivery_2_a": "We have included the delivery cost in the price of each product to make the purchase process as transparent and convenient as possible for our customers. This allows you to immediately see the final cost of the product without additional delivery expenses, regardless of the delivery country within Europe. This approach also simplifies the ordering process and makes our prices more competitive.",
      "delivery_3_q": "Which countries do you deliver to?",
      "delivery_3_a": "We deliver to all European Union countries, as well as the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Norway. Delivery times may vary depending on the country: Czech Republic - 1-2 days, neighboring countries (Slovakia, Poland, Germany, Austria) - 2-4 days, other EU countries - 3-7 days. Delivery is to your door.",
      "delivery_4_q": "How do I track my order?",
      "delivery_4_a": "After shipping your order, you will receive an email with a tracking number. Using this number, you can track the package's movement on the transport company's website (DPD or GLS). Additionally, our manager will inform you about key delivery stages: order confirmation, transfer to delivery service, expected delivery date.",
      "delivery_5_q": "What documents are provided with delivery?",
      "delivery_5_a": "With each order, you receive a complete set of documents: warranty card, installation instructions in your language, sales receipt. For companies, we provide all necessary accounting documents, including an invoice. All documentation is provided in the language of the delivery country or in English upon request.",
      "delivery_6_q": "How is the product packaged for delivery?",
      "delivery_6_a": "We use special protective packaging: each kit is placed in a sturdy box with shock-absorbing inserts protecting from impacts and vibration. The LED strip and electronic components are additionally protected by anti-static bags. The outer packaging has a waterproof layer and \"Fragile!\" marking. All components are securely fixed inside the box.",
      "delivery_7_q": "What should I do if the product arrives damaged?",
      "delivery_7_a": "In the unlikely event of receiving damaged goods: 1) Immediately document the damage with photos/video and note it in the delivery note. 2) Contact us by phone or email within 24 hours. 3) We will organize a free return and product replacement. All return and replacement costs are covered by us. Replacement is done as quickly as possible, usually within 1-3 business days.",
      "delivery_8_q": "Is express delivery possible?",
      "delivery_8_a": "Yes, we can arrange express delivery for urgent orders. Within Prague, same-day delivery is available for orders placed before 12:00. For other cities in the Czech Republic and neighboring countries, next-day delivery is possible. The cost of express delivery is included in the product price.
